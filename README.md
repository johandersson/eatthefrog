Task manager for Windows integrated with Outlook tasks and calendar. 

Assumes you have outlook and pywin32 installed on Windows. (And excel if you want to export time reports).

To install pywin32:
pip install pywin32

I have assigned a keyboard shortcut in Windows (CTRL-Shift-I) to easily add items to Outlook tasks. You can enter several and make them high prio by adding a ! in the end (more options described in the inbox.py window).
