# Eat the frog (A-B-C) for Windows
Task manager for Windows integrated with Outlook tasks and calendar based on ABC priority of tasks (A with color code red, B yellow, C green). 

The program is reads and writes the tasks in Outlook, so you don't need this program to work according to the A-B-C method, but the program is thought to simplify the process.

# Features
- Easily add several tasks at the same time. This is useful for when you use the To do view in the program as an "Inbox" to quickly add tasks to your pending tasks. 
- Search for tasks
- Task focus timer
- Print your daily A-B-C todo list
- Create calendar event based on task with A-B-C color coding
  
# Today view
In this view the tasks that have been categorized A, B, or C is shown. The intention with the program and the method is that you should create a todo list everyday with the most important tasks to do that day. So A are the ones that really has to be done, B are the ones that could be done but that mustn't, C are does not need to be done now, but it's good if they are done.

If you don't finish them the current day, the will stay in the today view until you move them to the Inbox view.

# To do view (Inbox)
The tasks that you need to track, but that you haven't yet prioritized are put in the To do view, it's like a backlog of stuff that needs to be done someday but that you haven't yet cateogorized with A, B or C. Add tasks here by entering some text in the input box above the tasks.

# Done today view
In this view you can see tasks that you have marked done today. If you want to view tasks that where marked done in the past, you can go to Search.

# Flagged emails
This view contains a list of emails that you have flagged in your Outlook inbox. You can create tasks based on them, unflag them, and mark them as done.

# Due dates
If a task from the Todo view has a due date when the program is loading, the task will be automatically moved to the Today view with category "A".

## Add several tasks
You can add several tasks at the same time by pressing CTRL+i or just i (or use the File -> Add several tasks menu). I stands for Inbox.

## Why not use priority level that is already built in Outlook?
Because you might have already prioritized tasks in Outlook with theese, and the thought behind the program is not to show all your tasks in the A-B-C list all the time, but the ones you think you are able to finish today. Therefore you need to prioritize your current tasks in the program with A-B-C, or in Outlook.

If you don't already have the categories A, B and C saved in Outlook, the program will create them the first time you run it. It will set them with the colors use in this method, green for A, yellow for B, and green for C tasks.

The priority from Outlook, high, normal, low is used in the Inbox view to sort the tasks. So there you can choose which ones to then categorize with ABC which is supposed to be the tasks that you intend to do the current working day.

## Create calendar events based on a task and it's ABC-priority
You can also create calendar events in outlook based on a task item, and that calendar event will use the priority color code of the task.

## Search tasks
You can search for tasks, both completed and not completed.

## Requirements
Assumes you have Microsoft Outlook installed on Windows. (And excel if you want to export time reports).
