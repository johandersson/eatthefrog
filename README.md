# Eat the frog (A-B-C) for Windows
Task manager for Windows integrated with Outlook tasks and calendar based on ABC priority of tasks (A with color code red, B yellow, C green). The intention with the program and the method is that you should create a todo list everyday with the most important tasks to do that day. So A are the ones that really has to be done, B are the ones that could be done but that mustn't, C are does not need to be done now, but it's good if they are done.

The program is integrated and reads and writes the tasks in Outlook, so you don't need this program to work according to the A-B-C method, but the program is thought to simplify the process.

# The inbox or backlog
The tasks that you need to track, but that you haven't yet prioritized are put in the "Inbox", it's like a backlog of stuff that needs to be done someday but that you haven't yet cateogorized with A, B or C. If you choose "No category" when you create a new task with CTRL+n or use the + button, the tasks will be listed under the "Inbox" button (and if you open Outlook, these tasks have no category set).

## Add several tasks
You can add several tasks at the same time by pressing CTRL+i or just i (or use the File -> Add several tasks menu). I stands for Inbox.

## Why not use priority level that is already built in Outlook?
Because you might have already prioritized tasks in Outlook with theese, and the thought behind the program is not to show all your tasks in the A-B-C list all the time, but the ones you think you are able to finish today. Therefore you need to prioritize your current tasks in the program with A-B-C, or in Outlook

If you don't already have the categories A, B and C saved in Outlook, the program will create them the first time you run it. It will set them with the colors use in this method, green for A, yellow for B, and green for C tasks.

## Create calendar events based on a task and it's ABC-priority
You can also create calendar events in outlook based on a task item, and that calendar event will use the priority color code of the task.

You can search tasks and also add outlook notes.

Assumes you have outlook installed on Windows. (And excel if you want to export time reports).
