Task manager for pywin32 and outlook

Assumes you have outlook and pywin32 installed on Windows.

To install pywin32:
pip install pywin32

I have assigned a keyboard shortcut in Windows (CTRL-Shift-I) to easily add items to Outlook tasks. You can enter several and make them high prio by adding a ! in the end (more options described in the inbox.py window).
